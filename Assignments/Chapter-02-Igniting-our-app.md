1. What is 'NPM'?

NPM is a package manager. It is a standard repository for the dependencies or packages.

2. What is 'Parcel/Webpack'? Why do we need it?

Parcel/Webpack are bundlers which are used in our react project. Parcel and Webpack are build tools in web development. They bundle and optimize web assets for faster loading and improved development workflow. Webpack requires explicit configuration, while Parcel offers zero-config simplicity. These tools are essential for organizing code, optimizing performance, and handling assets in modern web development.

3. What is '.parcel-cache'?
The .parcel-cache directory is a folder created by the Parcel bundler in your project directory. It is used to cache compiled and processed assets during the development and build processes. Caching helps speed up subsequent builds by storing previously processed files so that they don't need to be recompiled or processed from scratch.

4. What is 'npx'?
Npx is used for executing a package.

5.  What is difference between 'depandencies' and 'devDependencies'?

dependencies: Required for the production version of your application. These are libraries and packages needed to run the application.

devDependencies: Used for development and testing purposes. These include tools, testing frameworks, and utilities that assist in development but are not required for the production application.

6. What is Tree Shaking?

Tree Shaking is a process in which unused code is removed from the files as it will increase loading time and execute  the code smoothly. It works by analyzing the dependencies in your code and removing any modules or functions that are not actually used, resulting in a smaller and more efficient bundle.

7. What is Hot Module Replacement(HMR)?

It is a feature in Parcel, that allows you to update modules in your application without requiring a full page refresh or losing the application's state. It speeds up development by applying code changes in real-time, making it easier and faster to see the effects of your code modifications. HMR is particularly useful during the development and debugging phases of web development.

8.  List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe 3 of them in your own words.

Parcel surely has amazing superpowers, below are the 5 superpowers of Pracel:
-HMR
-Image compression
-Differential Bundling
-Tree Shaking
-Minification

Below are the three superpowers description-

1.Minification:

Minification is the process of reducing the size of code files, typically JavaScript and CSS, by removing unnecessary characters like whitespace, comments, and renaming variables to shorter names.
The goal of minification is to optimize code for production by making it smaller and more efficient, which leads to faster loading times for web applications.
In Parcel, minification is a built-in feature that automatically applies these optimizations to your code during the bundling process.

2. Image Compression:

Image compression is the practice of reducing the file size of images while preserving acceptable visual quality.
It is crucial for web performance because large images can slow down page load times.
Parcel can automatically optimize and compress images in your project, making sure they are in an efficient format and size for web delivery.

3. Differential Bundling:

Differential bundling is a strategy used to create smaller bundles for users based on their browser's capabilities.
It involves generating multiple bundles optimized for different browser versions or feature sets.
When a user visits a website, the server can serve the bundle that best matches the user's browser, reducing the amount of unnecessary code sent to the client.
Parcel has a feature called "differential loading" that helps generate optimized bundles for modern and legacy browsers, improving loading performance for both.

9. What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?

 .gitignore is a file in Git that lists files and directories to be ignored. Add generated files, dependencies, IDE/editor files, sensitive info, and user-specific files. Don't add source code, essential configurations, documentation, version-controlled files.

10. What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`?

- **`package.json`**: A metadata file containing project information, scripts, and dependency lists. It's manually editable and meant for project configuration and human reading.

- **`package-lock.json`**: Automatically generated by npm, it locks down specific dependency versions and their sub-dependencies to ensure consistency across different environments. It's machine-readable and primarily used for dependency version locking.


11. Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?

You should not modify `package-lock.json` because:

- It is automatically generated and maintained by npm to ensure consistency across different environments.
- Modifying it manually can lead to dependency conflicts and compatibility issues.
- Changes to this file may break your project's dependencies and cause unexpected behavior.
- It's designed to be a machine-generated, deterministic record of your project's dependencies, and manual edits can disrupt that purpose.


12. What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?

node_modules: Directory containing project dependencies in Node.js and it contains all the dependencies details as well as transitive dependency details. This folder is automatically generated whenever any package is installed using npm.

We should not push `node_modules` folder to git because it is large in size, redundancy, and version control inefficiency.and we can generate this folder accordingly and it acts differently across local and server. Therefore it’s not a good idea to push 'node_modules` on git. Instead, include package.json, package-lock.json or yarn.lock, and use package managers to install dependencies.

13. What is `dist` folder?

'dist` is a special folder which is responsible for rendering our app on server. `dist` stands for distibution.It contains all the development build file but when application is build in production environment, then all the production build file is created inside `dist` folder.

`dist` folder is responsible for sending data to server.


14. What is `browserslists`?

`Browserslists` :- As We know that parcel provide browser compatibility. `Browserslists` is responsible for this feature. `browserslists` is an array which is used to filter browser wise, version wise , region wise etc.

Ex:- 
         “browserslist”: “last 2 Chrome versions”
         “browserslist”: “last 2  versions

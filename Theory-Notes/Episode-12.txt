 -----------REDUX-------------
 Data Management Library/State management library - Redux

 Redux or Redux toolkit - to do the same thing as useContext

 Redux also creates a store, a central store - from where we can access all of it.

 Context vs Redux store

 small/medium - useContext
 large - Redux(can use useContext but redux gives scalability)

 React and Redux are different libraries. Redux is not mandatory but can be used when required.

 Redux alternative - Zustand(checkout)

Redux is used to manage the state of our application.Application becomes easier to debug.

Chrome extension to debug - Redux dev tools

Redux is a predictable state container for JS Apps

Will use React-Redux(bindings for React) and Redux Toolkit libraries(opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development)

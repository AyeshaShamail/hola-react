----- Types of testing done by developers-------
1. Unit testing -- Testing react components in isolation - only one specific component is being tested and not the whole react application
2. Integration testing -- Integration of many components which are talking to each other where we develop the flow of action
3. End-end testing (e2e testing) - Testing the entire application flows from user landing on the page to leaving the app - simulating how user will flow across the app - requires different types of tools like Selenium,Cypress, Puppeteer

npm create-react-app installation already have react-testing library,bundlers,state managemnet and routing integrated in it
Since we're building from scratch we're installing

React testing library uses JEST BTS

React testing library takes something known as JEST(delightful JS testing framework with a focus on simplicity)

------------- How to set up react app to write the test cases -------------

Libraries - React testing library - npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react or npm i -D @testing-library/react (saving as dev dependency) 

Installing JEST into our application - npm install -D Jest

Since we're using along with Babel(Transpiler), let's intsall - npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env - parcel already uses babel and it has its own babel configuration - now when we write our own babel configuration, it kinda over rides the parcel configuration for babel and keep this

Once all are installed now configure babel in babel.config.js - create babel.config.js file in the root and write the code present in backticks

`module.exports = {
  presets: [["@babel/preset-env", { targets: { node: "current" } }]],
};`

To make our own configuration to use babel config and not parcel babel config, do changes in RC file of parcel - create rc file in root called .parcelrc and paste the code embedded with backticks
`{
  "extends": "@parcel/config-default",
  "transformers": {
    "*.{js,mjs,jsx,cjs,ts,tsx}": [
      "@parcel/transformer-js",
      "@parcel/transformer-react-refresh-wrap"
    ]
  }
}`
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To run test cases - npm run test

-------------------- JEST Configuration---------------------------------------

-- npx jest --init
Answer below qsn 
1. No because we're not using Typescript
2. jsdom(browser-like)
3. yes
4. babel
5. yes

The following questions will help Jest to create a suitable configuration for your project

✔ Would you like to use Typescript for the configuration file? … no
✔ Choose the test environment that will be used for testing › jsdom (browser-like)
✔ Do you want Jest to add coverage reports? … yes
✔ Which provider should be used to instrument code for coverage? › babel
✔ Automatically clear mock calls, instances, contexts and results before every test? … yes

-------------------- Install jsdom library---------------------------------------
Go to react testing library>React Testing Library > Setup >Jest 28 section(depend on version u have installed)> npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom
 
-D === --save-dev

-- jsdom(browser-like) - when we write test cases, they don't have server means they don't run on google chrome. So to run we need a server or run-time where test cases can be executed - jsdom is like a browser

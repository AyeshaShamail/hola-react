#Talk is cheap, let's code!

App name chosen is - #SavoryAmigo

For writing CSS for example-
const RestaurantCard = () => {
  return (
    <div
      className="restaurant-card"
      style={{
        backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0",
      }}
    >
      <h3>Al-Daaz</h3>
    </div>
  );
};
 /**One curly brace is for there's some piece of JS in it and second bracket is Javascript object */ --  style={{
        backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0",
      }}


-- props are just normal arguments to the function.Prop is an Javascript object.

-- props that are passed to a react component are JS objects.

-- **When you have to dynamically pass some data to component, pass it as a props**

-- ***Config Driven UI - website defined by config - controlling UI using data/config which is coming from backend.Config-driven UI is a technique that allows you to create user interfaces based on a configuration file, such as JSON, or a TypeScript file that defines the layout and content of the UI components. This can be useful for creating dynamic and customizable UIs without hard coding them***

-- map/filter/reduce - learn

--*** whenever we are using map or looping onto a list, always give unique key to uniquely identify the element and avoid re-rendering every element every time ***

React doesn't uniquely identify the element and it re-renders every element, hence we have to use key.

Key can be either key={restaurant.data.id} or key={index}, which is second argument of map but React doesn't recommend index as keys

==> not using keys(not acceptable) <<<< index as key <<< using unique id as key (best practice)

Read index as an key is an anti-pattern - https://robinpokorny.com/blog/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern/

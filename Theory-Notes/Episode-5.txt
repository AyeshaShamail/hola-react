1. Learning about industry standard folder structure
-- Not mandatory but recommended.
-- Never Keep hard coded data in components file.
-- Keep image src links in folder called utils/common/consonants - utilities to be used anywhere in the app.
-- Name all the constants in a CAPITAL or SNAKE CASE

2. Export and Import 
-- First export(give) and then import(take)
-- Not necessary to use extension in imports, it still works. 
-- There are two types of imports and exports i.e., named and default.
-- In one file, we can have only one default export.
-- For multiple exports, we have named exports by mention "export" behind function name i.e export const CDN_URL ="";
-- Named imports are imported as import {CDN_URL} from "../../utils/constants"

Default export/imports
-- export default Component;
-- import Component from "path";

Named export/imports
-- export const Component;
-- import {Component} from "path";

3. React Hooks
-- Super power React variable is also called as state variable. It is like a variable/state of a component. It can be done using Hooks i.e., useState
-- Hook is just a normal JS function which is pre built and has logic built inside it,it is a utility function given by React.
-- Two import react hooks i.e., useState and useEffect.
-- useState - used to generate super powerful react variables and state variable. It maintains the state of the component.It is a spacial state/react variable.
-- The super powerful variable keeps the UI in sync with the data layer.
-- As soon as the state variable updates, react re-renders the components and very optimized way.

4. Event-handlers
5. React App has data layer and UI layer. UI layer will show what data layer is sending
6. Filtering

7. Why react is Fast?
-- Because it does faster,efficient DOM manipulation.

8. Render in react - Whenever a state variable updates(changes), React re-renders(
A second or subsequent render to update the state is called as re-rendering.) the components.

9. Reconciliation(whenever something changes in UI) Algorithm is used by React - Also known as React Fiber - A highest level description of React's reconciliation algorithm.
-- 

10. Virtual DOM - Not an actual DOM (tags) - Virtual DOM is a representation of actual DOM. The JS object is a virtual DOM.

11. Diff algorithm finds out difference between two virtual DOM's(updated and previous V'DOM) on every render cycle

React Fiber came in React-16 , it's a new algorithm to update the DOM . It's a new way of finding the diff and updating the DOM and that's how react becomes faster.

React doesn't touch HTML. Whenever a state variable is updated, react will find out the diff and update the DOM.

-- React is fast because it's doing efficient DOM manipulation because of V'DOM.

-- useState returns an array - Array destructuring

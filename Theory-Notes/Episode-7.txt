UseEffect is called every time my component is rendered.Since we are using the dependency array, it changes the behavior of its render.
Dependency array is not mandatory.

If no dependency array , useEffect is called on every render cycle.
If there is empty dependency array , useEffect is called on only initial render(just once, when component is rendered for the first time)
if there's anything in dependency array, useEffect is only called when the dependency changes/updates.

useState - It is used for creating local state variable inside our functional component

Never create useState(stateVariables) outside of the component.
Always call this at the top so that there's no inconsisitency in our code.
Don't use useState inside the if-else, it can create the inconsisitency in our code.
don't use inside functions/for-loop.
